## Compatibility

IE is your problem.

## Run

```
$ npm start
```

## Build (and test) without run

```
$ gulp
```

# UPDATE!
I think that all the smart people left the VK company. Now other staff members are breaking the API. There isn't a compatibility with the previous versions. I don't have any spare time and I don't want to fix this one. Fuck MailRu Group!
